///STACKS
/*Linear Data Structure
 * Elements are arranged in sequential
 * Follows LIFO - Last In First Out
 * Push - Inserting n element into the stack
 * Pop: Deleting an element from the stack
 * Top: - top of stack [push][pop]
 *                  top = -1
 * */
/// Implemented in two ways
/* - Using Arrays
 * - Linked Lists
 * */
/// Overflow Condition
/* - when the stack is full
 * - Used in push operation
 * - Inserting an element to the stack which is already having maximum elements
 * */
/// Underflow Condition
/* - Deleting an element from an empty stack
 * */
