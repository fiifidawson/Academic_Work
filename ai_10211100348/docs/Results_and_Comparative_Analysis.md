### Test Prompts
#### Relevance
`Prompt: What is the fine for returning a library book late at Academic City?`

`RAG-LLM Response:`
```Python
"""The document states: A patron who keeps borrowed books beyond due dates shall pay a fine or have his/her certificate withheld until the book/item is either returned or a replacement fee is paid.

However, the amount of the fine is not specified in this document.

Therefore, the answer is: The document mentions a fine for late returns, but does not specify the amount."""
```

`ChatGPT Response:`
```Python
"""​The Academic City University College Student Handbook – September 2024 does not specify the exact fine amount for returning library books late. Additionally, the university's official website does not provide detailed information regarding late return fines.​

For the most accurate and up-to-date information on library fines, it is recommended to contact the Academic City Library directly. You can reach out to the library staff via email:​

Eric Amponsah Amoaful – Librarian: eric.amoaful@acity.edu.gh

`RAG-LLM Response:`
```Python
""" Here's a breakdown of the steps a student must follow to officially withdraw from Academic City University College, based on the provided text:

1. Before Departure:
  - Contact the Office of Student and Community Affairs or the Registry: The student must complete the procedures as presented by either of these offices prior to leaving the university.

2. Complete Procedures:
  - This involves following the specific steps outlined by the Office of Student and Community Affairs or the Registry. The documents do not explicitly specify what these procedures are, but they likely involve:
    - Returning any Academic City property.
    - Settling any outstanding financial obligations (fees, fines, etc.).
    - Completing any required paperwork.
    - Signing out at the office of the Dean of Students and Community Affairs. Provide vacation contact addresses including valid telephone numbers and active email addresses at the office of the Dean of Students and Community Affairs

3. Obtain Clearance Certificate:
  - Upon completing the procedures, the student should receive a signed clearance certificate from the Office of Student and Community Affairs or the Registry.

Consequences of Not Following Procedures:
  - No Clearance Certificate: Failure to obtain a signed clearance certificate will result in transcripts, recommendations, and referrals being withheld. For students following the completion of a program of study, graduation certificates will be withheld.

  - Unreturned Property: Failure to return Academic City property may result in additional financial fees. Failure to pay financial fees will result in additional repercussions.

Important Considerations:
  - Withdrawal vs. Deferral: It's important to distinguish between withdrawing from the university and deferring studies. If a student intends to return at a later date, they should formally defer their studies by writing to the Registrar, stating all details and dates regarding the deferment.
  - Fees: Registration fees are non-transferable and non-refundable. """

#### Contextual Understanding
`Prompt: Can students carry pepper spray for self-defense on campus?`
`RAG-LLM Response:`
```Python
""" Based on the provided text, students are likely prohibited from carrying pepper spray for self-defense on campus. Here's why:

  - Section 2.4.1: 8 WEAPONS, DANGEROUS INSTRUMENTS, AND EXPLOSIVE CHEMICALS states that the possession, use, or threat of use of any object that may reasonably be believed to cause physical injury to another person is prohibited.

  - Section 2.4.1.5 k) prohibits the possession of firearms, fireworks, explosives, incendiaries, knives of any kind, and other types of weapons on college property or at any college function, particularly if there is the intent, or possibility of causing harm or damage.

  - Although not explicitly named, pepper spray falls under the category of an object that may cause physical injury and a type of weapon.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that pepper spray is prohibited under these policies."""
```

`ChatGPT Response:`
```Python
"""​The Academic City University College Student Handbook – September 2024 does not explicitly mention policies regarding the possession or use of pepper spray on campus. Therefore, it's unclear whether students are permitted to carry pepper spray for self-defense purposes.​

To obtain accurate and up-to-date information on this matter, it is advisable to contact the university's administration directly. You can reach out to the Office of Student Affairs or the Campus Security Office for clarification on the university's policies concerning self-defense items like pepper spray.

```

`Prompt: If a student misses registration, can they still take the semester’s courses?`
`RAG-LLM Response:`
```Python
"""No, a student who fails to register for a course shall forfeit the opportunity to take it that semester. Failure to register by the end of the penalty period shall preclude a student from the semester. """
```
`ChatGPT Response:`
```Python
""" Yes, students who miss the initial registration deadline at Academic City University College may still be able to register for courses for the semester, but this is subject to specific conditions and potential penalties.​

- Late Registration Possibility
While the university sets official registration deadlines—such as 20 September 2024 for Fall 2024 and 31 January 2025 for Spring 2025 —​it does not explicitly prohibit late registration. However, late registration is not guaranteed and typically requires approval from the Registrar's Office.​

- Late Registration Fees
If permitted to register late, students may incur a late fee of USD 100 (or GHS 1,350) if payment is not received within three days after the due date. ​

- Recommended Actions
If you've missed the registration deadline:

  - Contact the Registrar's Office Immediately: Reach out to explain your situation and inquire about the possibility of late registration.​

  - Be Prepared for Additional Fees: Understand that late registration may come with extra costs, including the aforementioned late fee.​

  - Act Promptly: The sooner you address the missed deadline, the higher your chances of being allowed to register late.​

For personalized assistance, you can contact the Registrar's Office:
  - Phone: +233 59 403 0308​
  - Email: info@acity.edu.gh​

It's crucial to communicate promptly with the university to explore your options and minimize any potential disruptions to your academic progress. """

`Prompt: List all restricted activities in the library and explain why they are prohibited.`
`RAG-LLM Response:`
```Python
"""Here's a list of restricted activities in the library based on the provided text, along with explanations for why they are prohibited:

- a) Cell phone communication: Prohibited to maintain a quiet environment conducive to studying and reading. Other users may be disturbed by phone conversations. [Confidence: 100%]
- b) Discussions, talking, and laughing: Similar to cell phone use, these activities can disrupt the quiet atmosphere needed for focused work and concentration by other patrons. [Confidence: 100%]
- c) Defacing or destruction of property and materials: This is prohibited to preserve library resources for all users and prevent unnecessary expenses for repair or replacement. [Confidence: 100%]
- d) Unauthorized removal of library materials: This prevents resources from being available to other patrons and disrupts the library's collection management. [Confidence: 100%]
- e) Boisterous behavior including running, throwing of objects: Such behavior disrupts the library environment, poses a safety hazard, and can damage library property. [Confidence: 100%]
- f) Fighting: Fighting creates a disturbance, is a safety risk to individuals, and violates the peaceful environment of the library. [Confidence: 100%]
- g) Inappropriate display of affection: Public displays of affection can make other patrons uncomfortable and are generally considered inappropriate in a professional setting like a library. [Confidence: 100%]
- h) Inappropriate language: Profane, lewd, or obscene language is disruptive and offensive to other patrons and staff. [Confidence: 100%]
- i) Possession of firearms, fireworks, or other weapons: Weapons pose a safety threat to all individuals in the library. [Confidence: 100%]
- j) Smoking: Smoking is often prohibited in public buildings due to health concerns and fire hazards. [Confidence: 100%]
- k) Placing of feet on tables and chairs: This is considered disrespectful to library property and can damage furniture. [Confidence: 100%]
- m) Foods and drinks: Food and drinks can damage library materials, attract pests, and create a mess. [Confidence: 100%]
- n) Loitering: Loitering can disrupt the library environment and may raise security concerns if individuals are present without a clear purpose. [Confidence: 100%]
- o) Failure to return recalled items by the due date: This prevents other patrons from accessing needed materials and disrupts the library's circulation system. [Confidence: 100%]
- p) Taking an item out of the library without completing the appropriate loan procedure: Same reasoning as unauthorized removal of library materials. [Confidence: 100%]
- q) Entry to the library with Gowns, raincoats, umbrellas, cameras, scanners, tape recorders, etc.: These items must be deposited at the security desk. [Confidence: 100%]
- r) Entry into the library with bags: no bags shall be permitted entry into the library. They should be left in the space provided: This is likely a security measure to prevent theft or the introduction of prohibited items. [Confidence: 100%]"""

|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relevance**             | ✅ Extracted exact policy content from the uploaded document, explicitly noting the fine is mentioned but not quantified. | ⚠️ Referred users to email library staff and relied on external sources (e.g., GCTU), which are irrelevant to ACITY.     |
| **Fluency**               | ✅ Responses were clearly written, structured, and bullet-pointed as requested (especially dress code prompt).     | ✅ Very fluent, polished, and human-like wording with logical formatting.                                                  |
| **Completeness**          | ✅ Covered all steps from official withdrawal policy, including consequences of non-compliance.                   | ⚠️ Added assumptions and extra steps not found in ACITY's handbook (e.g., 25% refund tiers, VP-level approvals).          |
| **Contextual Understanding** | ✅ Correctly interpreted implicit rules (e.g., pepper spray not mentioned but inferred from weapon policy).           | ⚠️ Avoided drawing conclusions, gave non-committal answers, and directed users to external offices.                       |
| **Response Time**         | ⚠️ Longer and exhaustive (high latency), but returned comprehensive structured answers.                           | ✅ Fast and concise, though often padded with generic or assumed policy responses.                                         |
