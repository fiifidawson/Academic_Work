# Biomedical Signal Analysis Lab Session

## Information about the Dataset

The dataset consists of **14 attributes**:

1. **Age**: The age of the patient.
2. **Sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female).
3. **Chest Pain Type (cp)**: 
   - 1: typical angina
   - 2: atypical angina
   - 3: non-anginal pain
   - 4: asymptomatic
4. **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)**: Measured in mm Hg, normal values are between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg.
5. **Serum Cholesterol (chol)**: Measured in mg/dl.
6. **Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)**: (1 = true; 0 = false) Whether the fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl.
7. **Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)**:
   - 0: normal
   - 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
   - 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria.
8. **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)**: The maximum heart rate, calculated by subtracting the patient's age from 220. For example, for a 50-year-old, the max heart rate is 170 beats per minute.
9. **Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)**: (1 = yes; 0 = no).
10. **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11. **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)**: 
    - 1: upsloping
    - 2: flat
    - 3: downsloping
12. **Number of Major Vessels (ca)**: Ranges from 0 to 3, colored by fluoroscopy.
13. **Thalassemia (thal)**: 
    - 3 = normal
    - 6 = fixed defect
    - 7 = reversible defect
14. **Heart Disease (target)**: The main target variable, indicating whether a patient has heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no).

## Objectives for the Lab Session

- The primary task is to **predict** whether a patient has heart disease based on the above attributes.
  
## Key Clinical Insights

1. **Exercise-Induced ST Segment Depression**:
   - A reliable ECG finding for diagnosing obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.
   - Associated with a worse prognosis for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

2. **Thalassemia**:
   - An inherited blood disorder causing reduced hemoglobin levels, leading to anemia and fatigue.
   - Mild forms of thalassemia may not require treatment.

3. **Resting Blood Pressure**:
   - Normal range: 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg.

4. **Maximum Heart Rate**:
   - Calculated as 220 minus the patient's age.

## Lab Exercise

- **Explore the Data**: Analyze each attribute to understand its significance in predicting heart disease.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on the dataset attributes.
